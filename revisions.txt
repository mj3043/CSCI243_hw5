Revisions:

1. Implemented BST (Binary Search Tree) structure and core functions:
   - bst_insert(): inserts a word and records line numbers.
   - bst_traverse(): in-order traversal printing word frequencies and references.
   - bst_cleanup(): frees all dynamically allocated memory.

2. Fixed memory allocation issues:
   - Added error checking for malloc() and realloc().
   - Used strdup() for copying word strings safely.

3. Adjusted BST insertion logic:
   - Used strcasecmp() for case-insensitive comparisons.
   - Added helper function add_ref() to expand and append line references.

4. Corrected output formatting:
   - Ensured each line prints as "word (freq):  line1, line2, ..."
   - Matched spacing to reference output exactly (two spaces after colon).

5. Verified correctness and memory safety:
   - Tested with input.1 and input.2.
   - Used diff to match stdout.1 and stdout.2 — outputs identical.
   - Ran Valgrind: 0 memory leaks, 0 errors.

Final status:
✅ All tests passed.
✅ No memory leaks.
✅ Output matches expected results.
